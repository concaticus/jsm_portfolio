### Intent & How it's made

The intent and purpose behind this website was to build functional site, employing working knowledge of several important technologies, such as HTML5, SASS, JavaScript, Git & GitHub, in order to design an online presence for myself as a future developer. Consquently, this portfolio was made utilising the following technologies:

- **HTML5**
- **SASS**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Sanity**
