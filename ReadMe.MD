### Intent & How it's made

The intent and purpose of this portfolio is to showcase

the intent and purpose behind this website was to build functional site, employing working knowledge of several important technologies, in order to design an online presence for myself as a future developer. Consquently, this portfolio was made utilising the following technologies:

- **HTML5**
- **SASS**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Sanity**
  Further more, this site will be worked on, improved, and returned too over again in order to also serve as a repository for completed & future projects. My hope is that this will also illustrate my passions, interests, but importantly, my tech related work and skills.
